# amba_modules
I have developed the rtl design for AMBA MODULES , the first one is the axi module where we are introducing the axi4_master ,axi4_slave and the top module. The master and the slave part has external pins so that we can write and read data from peripheral devices.


The other module as APB is also present, where there one APB_MASTER and APB_Slave , the slave is acting with no wait state.
